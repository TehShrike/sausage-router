Lets you use the [hash-brown-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/hash-brown-router), but without the hashes!  Uses pushState and replaceState.

# Usage

```js
var sausage = require('sausage-router')
var makeRouter = require('hash-brown-router')

var router = makeRouter(sausage())
```

router has the same interface as the [hash-brown-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/hash-brown-router).
